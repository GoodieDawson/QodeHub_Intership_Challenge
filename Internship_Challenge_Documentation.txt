This news app was developed for written in JAVA using Android Studio for use on android devices. It contains the supplied backend of articles as one of its asset files. Whenever this app is launched, this JSON file containing our relevant articles is parsed, and the JSONArray of articles is extracted from it and stored as a JSONString. Using this string, each article is extracted and is stored as a corresponding article object. This is an object of an Article class that was created to encapsulate this information. These articles objects are stored in an ArrayList which is the passed through a custom adapter allowing these objects to populate a ListView for the user to see. The user can then click on any news item the wish and the corresponding object is passed to a new activity which retrieves the articles text information from the object and displays it for the user. The user can then move back and forth between these screens.
